I am a Research Associate in the <a href="https://www.ml.cmu.edu/">Machine Learning Department</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a> advised by Professor <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bapoczos/">Barnabás Póczos</a>. 
 
I am broadly interested in multi-task learning, natural language processing, and never ending learning. I believe that language compositionality tightly couples the aforementioned
subject areas: abstract problems can be mapped to standard expressions that are naturally combined under a unified framework. Moreover, I believe that research in these areas may bring us closer to bridging the gap between human and machine learning.  

Currently I am working compositional visual question answering, and explaining anomalies in video scenes using natural language. Previously, I have researched relation extraction and knowledge graph link prediction. I have proposed frameworks that improve model performances in both problems as well as introduced a new relation extraction dataset. 

I hold a Bachelors degree in Statistics and Machine Learning from Carnegie Mellon University with School of Computer Science and University Honors.
